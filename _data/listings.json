        "property_description": "ROCA VIEWS IBIZA: A MASTERPIECE BY FRAN SILVESTRE ARQUITECTOS Set on the hillsides of Ibiza, Roca Views is an architectural gem designed by the renowned Valencia-based studio Fran Silvestre Arquitectos. With minimalist elegance and exceptional technical precision, the home is conceived as a single continuous element, made of thin folded plates just 9 centimeters thick, following the natural topography. Architecture and landscape blend into an expansive and sophisticated minimalist expression. Three subtly differentiated volumes — garage, day area, and night area — merge into a fluid unity, maintaining perfect spatial continuity and visual harmony. Instead of resisting the slope, the architecture embraces the terrain and interacts naturally with the surroundings. The thin structural skin functions as both walls and ceilings, while also defining the architectural language of the project. Every fold enhances the frontal and lateral views, transforming the house into a natural observatory: a shaded retreat that captures and frames the spectacular landscapes of Ibiza’s hills. More than just a technical solution for hillside construction, Roca Views is a manifesto of architectural sensitivity: a home that blends seamlessly into nature, creating a fascinating contrast between the raw beauty of the trees and the purity of extreme minimalism. A work of exceptional design and one of the most unique lifestyle opportunities in Ibiza. Proximities",

The ground floor is divided into a spacious living area consisting of two comfortable and bright living rooms, a kitchen with utility room and 2 bedrooms with a shared bathroom. The master bedroom with en suite bathroom and private terrace is located on the upper floor, next to a cosy living room with fireplace and 2 further bedrooms with a shared bathroom and a balcony. The property presents an exceptional investment opportunity with various development prospects that cater to diverse investor preferences and financial goals: 1. Guest House Development as an Annex Investors have the option to construct a guest house attached to the main property, with a restriction of 1,500 cubic meters for both structures. This approach offers a streamlined process, cost-effectiveness, and efficient time management, providing additional accommodations while ensuring compliance with building regulations. 2. Independent Registered Guest House Alternatively, investors can choose to develop a guest house as a separate registered property by allocating a distinct entity for it. Adhering to specific parameters and regulations, such as obtaining required permits and approvals, allows investors to establish a unique property with legal autonomy. This strategy may enhance market value and rental income potential, with specifications including a maximum volume of 1,500 cubic meters, a buildable area of 500 m2, an average height of 3 meters, and up to two storeyswith a regulated height of 7 meters. 3. Segregation for Multiple Independent Houses Investors can explore segregating the property to build up to six autonomous houses, each with its registry unit. Detailed assessments and compliance with legal requirements, such as law 12/2017, are crucial to determine building possibilities and regulatory guidelines. This approach offers flexibility and the potential for diversified revenue streams, addressing various housing demands and preferences. 4. Horizontal Division with Special Modality Leveraging the property’s E-U2 classification, investors can pursue horizontal division without segregation, enabling the development of all six houses seamlessly. This strategy streamlines the development process significantly, optimizing the property’s full potential for a comprehensive housing project. Proximities",

The main house, erected in 1978, features an appealing tower housing the master bedroom with an en suite bathroom. A generous terrace adjacent to the master bedroom provides a splendid view of the sea and nearby islands. Two additional bedrooms, a spacious living room, and a dining room complete the main house. The fully renovated guest house boasts a centrally positioned bed, a modern bathroom with a shower, a compact kitchen, a dressing room, and a cozy sitting area. Below, two rooms, yet to undergo renovation, come equipped with water and electricity connections, offering the potential to expand the complex to six bedrooms in total.

From the elevated infinity pool, one can relish spectacular views of Cala Tarida, surrounded by inviting outdoor spaces for sunbathing, sitting, and relaxation. The expansive garden beneath the terraces, adorned with ancient pine trees, imparts the property with the quintessential \"Ibiza island touch.\" Behind the main house lies the idyllic old \"farmer's garden,\" creating a serene environment under the canopy of trees. The property's grand driveway, bordered by dry stone walls and featuring an electric gate, adds to its allure. Ample parking spaces for residents and guests are available below the pool.
